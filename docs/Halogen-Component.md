## Module Halogen.Component


This module defines a type of composable _components_, built from
the types provided by this library - signal functions and HTML documents.

#### `Component`

``` purescript
type Component p m req res = SF1 req (HTML p (m res))
```

A component.

The type parameters are, in order:

- `m`, the monad used to track effects required by external requests
- `req`, the type of external requests
- `res`, the type of external responses

Request and response types are public, but the component may also use an _internal_ type
of messages, as illustrated by the type of the `component` function.

The main interface to Halogen is the `runUI` function, which takes a component as an argument,
with certain constraints between the type arguments. This module leaves the type arguments
unrestricted, allowing components to be composed in various ways.

If you do not use a particular feature (e.g. requests, responses, effects), you might like to leave
the corresponding type parameter unconstrained in the declaration of your component.

#### `hoistComponent`

``` purescript
hoistComponent :: forall p m n req res. (forall a. m a -> n a) -> Component p m req res -> Component p n req res
```

Map a natural transformation over the monad type argument of a `Component`.

This function may be useful during testing, to mock requests with a different monad.

#### `combine`

``` purescript
combine :: forall p m req1 req2 res1 res2. (Functor m) => (forall a. HTML p a -> HTML p a -> HTML p a) -> Component p m req1 res1 -> Component p m req2 res2 -> Component p m (Either req1 req2) (Either res1 res2)
```

Combine two components into a single component.

The first argument is a function which combines the two rendered HTML documents into a single document.

This function works on request and response types by taking the _sum_ in each component. The left summand
gets dispatched to (resp. is generated by) the first component, and the right summand to the second component.
